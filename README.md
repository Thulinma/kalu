# About this fork

The original author of kalu hasn't updated it for several years.
In the meanwhile, pacman has received some updates that make it incompatible.
To maintain kalu into the future, Thulinma created this fork of the original. It contains:

- The original author's untested [rm-delta](https://github.com/jjk-jacky/kalu/tree/rm-delta) branch, which removed delta support from the codebase
- The original author's [next](https://github.com/jjk-jacky/kalu/tree/next) branch, which included a Dutch translation and updates to use StatusNotifier 1.00
- Support for pacman 6.0: a collaborative effort between [jghodd](https://github.com/jghodd) and Thulinma.
- Support for newer versions of GCC (trivial patch, by Thulinma but several others had made near-identical patches before)
- Support for parallel downloads in the built-in updater (by Thulinma)

I intend to maintain this fork for the foreseeable future, as-needed (e.g. whenever anything breaks, or some important new feature is needed/missing). Should the original author return, the fork will most likely be abandoned in favour of the original.
For now, none of the copyright notices have been updated. This may still be done at a later date.

The rest of this README is verbatim the original README.

# kalu: Keeping Arch Linux Up-to-date

kalu (which could stand for "Keeping Arch Linux Up-to-date") is a small
application that will add an icon to your systray and sit there, regularly
checking if there's anything new for you to upgrade. As soon as it finds
something, it'll show a notification to let you know about it. Very classic
stuff.

## What makes kalu any different?

For starter, **it doesn't need root privileges** to do its checking. Not because
it doesn't synchronize databases, since that would make it mostly useless, but
because it will create a temporary copy of your sync databases, sync those, and
then remove them of course.

The idea is not only not to require root privileges, but more importantly to
**avoid putting you in a situation where you'd risk messing up your system**, as
you might unknowingly end up basically doing a `pacman -Sy foobar` (which is
pretty generally understood to be a bad idea).

Because if kalu did sync your databases, and there were upgrades available, but
you did not apply them right away (for one reason or another, e.g. you're busy,
or were AFK when the notification poped up and didn't see it...) then your next
-S operation would really be a -Sy, even though you might not even realize it.

## What does it check for?

kalu can check for a few things :

- **Arch Linux News**. To be sure not to miss an important announcement from
  Arch Linux's official website.

- **Available upgrades for installed packages**. That is, anything from one of
  the repos, or what would be upgraded with a `pacman -Syu`

- **Available upgrades for non-installed packages**. You can define a list of
  "watched packages", that is packages for which you'd like to be notified when
  an upgrade is out, even though they're not installed. (E.g. packages you
  repack for yourself to apply a patch or something)

- **Available upgrades for AUR packages**. All foreign packages (i.e. not found
  in any repo, aka `-Qm`) can be checked for upgrades available in the AUR.

- **Available upgrades for watched AUR packages**. Just like with "regular"
  packages, you can have a list of packages in the AUR for which you'd like to
  be notified when an upgrade is available, even though they're not installed.

Of course you don't have to use all of this, and you can define which of those
checks kalu should do. Besides maintaining lists of watched (AUR) packages, you
can also define a list of foreign packages that kalu should not check the AUR
for. Since there's no reason to check for packages you know aren't from the AUR
(e.g. packages of your own making).

## More than a notifier: kalu's updater

When a notification is shown, it will feature an action button. This button can
be used to simply trigger a process of your choosing, e.g. you could have it
start pacman with something like `urxvt -e sudo pacman -Syu`

However, **kalu comes with an integrated system upgrader**, which does exactly
the same, only in a GTK GUI. Before being able to synchronize your databases
(and possibly upgrade the system) the updater needs root privileges, obviously.

The way it works is: **kalu itself only contains the GUI**, and the part that
does interact with libalpm (to actually upgrade your system) is in a secondary
binary (`kalu-dbus`). This binary only will require root privileges, and will
rely on PolicyKit to ensure you are authorized before doing anything.

You can also define one or more processes to be run after completing a system
upgrade (to start e.g.
[localepurge](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=11975 "AUR: localepurge: Script to remove disk space wasted for unneeded localizations")
and/or [PkgClip](http://mywaytoarch.tumblr.com/post/16005116198/pkgclip-does-your-pacman-cache-need-a-trim
"PkgClip: Does your pacman cache need a trim?")), and kalu will start them after
each succesfull sysupgrade (and an optional confirmation, which for multiple
processes will feature the full list so you can specify which (if any) to
start).

Note that if you're not interested in this, you can remove it by specifying
`--disable-updater` on the `configure` command line.
